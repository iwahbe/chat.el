You > What would you call a major mode dedicated to chatting with an AI. Keep in mind that package names must be unique and should be short.
Bot > How about "AI-chat" or "AI-conv"? Both are short and easy to remember.
You > But emacs package names are always shishkabob case
Bot > Ah, my apologies for misunderstanding! In that case, "ai-chat-mode" or "ai-conv-mode" would be appropriate shishkabob case names for the\
 major mode.
You > Is there any reason why not just call it `chat-mode`?
Bot > Yes, that's a valid option as well! However, if you plan to have multiple chat modes in your Emacs setup, like a mode for IRC, Slack, or\
 Twitter, then it might be useful to prefix it with "ai-" for clarity and consistency. That way, you would have "ai-chat-mode" for chatting wi\
th an AI, "irc-chat-mode" for IRC, "slack-chat-mode" for Slack, and so on. But if you only plan to have one chat mode specifically for AI chat\
, then just "chat-mode" is perfectly fine.
You > Emacs already has an `irc` function. Does that change your oppinion?
Bot > Ah, I see! In that case, "chat-mode" would be a good choice since "irc-mode" already exists in Emacs. If you're building an AI chat feat\
ure on top of the existing "irc-mode" functionality, you could simply add a chatbot component to that mode and call it "irc-chat-mode" to dist\
inguish it from the regular "irc-mode". But if you're building a standalone mode dedicated solely to AI chat, "chat-mode" makes more sense to \
use.
You > That makes a lot of sense.
Bot > I'm glad I could help! Let me know if you have any other questions.
